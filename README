<Reliablity performance assessment model of RMS applied in different configuration orders>

This python file simulates for a model assessing reliablity performance of RMS applied in different configuration orders.
The illustrative case shows it applied in failure rate with Weibull distributions, but it could be adapted to other distributions by simply changing the pdf, cdf and failure rate functions.
Further details of usage, algorithms and maintenance will be added later.
